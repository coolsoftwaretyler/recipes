Add the potatoes to the boiling water and simmer until they are falling-apart tender, 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "Warm milk or cheese. While the potatoes boil, choose and warm your dairy. Now, this is decision time. For modest weeknight mashed potatoes, 1 tablespoon of butter and 1/2 cup of milk will be plenty of dairy. It will help the potatoes be creamy and smooth, and bind everything together. But if you want a more decadent experience, then by all means, dial it up! Switch out the milk for cream, and add an ounce of cream cheese or even a dollop of sour cream. It's up to you. The more fat, the creamier they will be. But whatever you choose, warm it first before adding to the potatoes. Warm the milk or cream in the microwave, and let any cream cheese or sour cream come to room temperature.",
      "Drain and mash the potatoes with the butter. When the potatoes are quite soft, drain them completely and return them to the pan over medium heat. Add the butter and cook for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring the potatoes rapidly and vigorously to help any residual water evaporate. You also want to break the potatoes up and smash them with the spoon. You can employ a fork to help, if you like, but you shouldn't need a ricer or a masher unless you want ultra-smooth potatoes. Just cook, stir, and smash.",
      "Add the dairy and season to taste. When any remaining water has evaporated, and the potatoes are quite smashed up and smooth, it's time to add the warm milk or cream, as well as any other dairy you'd like to throw in. Pour the milk in slowly, stirring constantly. Keep stirring and cooking until the potatoes are quite hot, creamy, and smooth. Turn off the heat, season to taste with pepper and salt, and dish them up! (You can also keep them warm in the top half of a double boiler.)"

Add 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and whisk until combined. Continue whisking for another couple minutes to cook the flour until thickened slightly, bubbly, and light golden brown. This is your roux.",
      "Quickly whisk the milk into the roux a cup or two at a time. It will thicken up considerably before you get a chance to add all of the milk. Just whisk vigorously with each round of milk and whisk until smooth after all of the milk has been added. Add 2 teaspoons dry mustard, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, and whisk to combine.",

      "Transfer half of the macaroni and cheese to the baking dish and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle with half of the reserved cheeses. Repeat layering the remaining macaroni and cheese and remaining shredded cheeses. Press the reserved mozzarella cheese cubes into the casserole if using. Sprinkle with the panko breadcrumbs if using.",

      "Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Fill medium saucepan with water and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, prep the potatoes.",
      "Peel, chop, and boil the potatoes. Peel the potatoes. Cut them in half, then in quarters, lengthwise. Then cut the quarters into thin strips. You can chop them finer, if you feel like it; the finer they are going into the water, the easier they will be to mash later. Add the potatoes to the boiling water and simmer until they are falling-apart tender, 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "Warm milk or cheese. While the potatoes boil, choose and warm your dairy. Now, this is decision time. For modest weeknight mashed potatoes, 1 tablespoon of butter and 1/2 cup of milk will be plenty of dairy. It will help the potatoes be creamy and smooth, and bind everything together. But if you want a more decadent experience, then by all means, dial it up! Switch out the milk for cream, and add an ounce of cream cheese or even a dollop of sour cream. It's up to you. The more fat, the creamier they will be. But whatever you choose, warm it first before adding to the potatoes. Warm the milk or cream in the microwave, and let any cream cheese or sour cream come to room temperature.",
      "Drain and mash the potatoes with the butter. When the potatoes are quite soft, drain them completely and return them to the pan over medium heat. Add the butter and cook for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring the potatoes rapidly and vigorously to help any residual water evaporate. You also want to break the potatoes up and smash them with the spoon. You can employ a fork to help, if you like, but you shouldn't need a ricer or a masher unless you want ultra-smooth potatoes. Just cook, stir, and smash.",
      "Add the dairy and season to taste. When any remaining water has evaporated, and the potatoes are quite smashed up and smooth, it's time to add the warm milk or cream, as well as any other dairy you'd like to throw in. Pour the milk in slowly, stirring constantly. Keep stirring and cooking until the potatoes are quite hot, creamy, and smooth. Turn off the heat, season to taste with pepper and salt, and dish them up! (You can also keep them warm in the top half of a double boiler.)"
