# Mustard Cream Pasta Recipe

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 large shallot, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup vegetable stock (not low-sodium)
- 3 cups roughly chopped Tuscan kale leaves (from 1 large bunch)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 1/2 pound rigatoni (or other short pasta shape)

## Directions

1. Set a large pot of water over high heat to come to a boil.
1. Melt the butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic and sauté until fragrant and the shallots are softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Stir in the mustard—it’s normal for separation to occur, and the sauce will come together as you add the other ingredients. Pour in the cream and vegetable stock and increase the heat to medium-high.
1. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until it slightly thickens, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Add the kale to the pan and cook until the greens soften, 1 to 2 minutes.
1. Add the salt, pepper, and honey and continue to cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed, then turn off the heat.
1. Generously salt the boiling water. Cook the rigatoni according to package instructions until al dente, reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.
1. Add the pasta to the pot with the sauce, returning the heat under the pan to low. Toss to combine, adding a splash of pasta water if necessary to reach a consistency you love. Garnish with freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately.
