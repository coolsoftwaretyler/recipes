## Ingredients 

* 1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1 15-oz. can black beans, rinsed
* 1 c. frozen corn
* 2 bell peppers, chopped
* 1 white onion, chopped
* 1 15-oz. can fire-roasted tomatoes
* 1/4 c. freshly chopped cilantro, plus more for garnish
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp. cumin
* 1 tbsp. chili powder
* 1 tsp. kosher salt
* 2 c. low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 c. shredded Monterey jack
* 1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* 3 small corn tortillas, cut into strips
* Sliced avocado, for serving

## Directions

1. In a large slow cooker, combine chicken, black beans, corn, peppers, onion, fire-roasted tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt, and chicken broth.
2. Cover and cook on low until chicken is cooked and falling apart, 5 to 6 hours.
3. Shred chicken with a fork, then top soup with Monterey Jack and cover to let melt, 5 minutes more.
4. Meanwhile, make tortilla crisps: In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add tortilla strips and cook until crispy and golden, 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.
5. Serve soup topped with tortilla crisps, avocado, sour cream, cilantro, and lime.
