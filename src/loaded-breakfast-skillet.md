# Loaded Breakfast Skillet Recipe | Kitchn

## Ingredients

- 1 pound Yukon Gold or russet potatoes,
- 1 (about 15-ounce) can pinto beans,
- 12 ounces uncooked breakfast sausage,
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt,
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper,
- 1 cup mild or medium salsa, plus more for serving,
- 1 1/4 cups shredded cheddar, pepper jack, or Mexican blend cheese, divided,
- 4 large eggs,
- 1 medium avocado,
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves,
- Tortilla chips or tortillas, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375Â°F.
1. Meanwhile, peel and cut 1 pound potatoes into 1-inch pieces.
1. Drain and rinse 1 can pinto beans.
1. Remove the casings from 12 ounces breakfast sausage if needed.
1. Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or ovenproof nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.
1. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving the fat in the pan.
1. Add the potatoes to the skillet and season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and can be easily pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes.
1. Add the beans, sausage, 1 cup salsa, and 1 cup of the shredded cheese. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer, then rescue heat to low. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Create 4 divots in the mixture with the back of a spoon. Crack 1 large egg into each divot.
1. Bake until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, pit and slice 1 avocado. Coarsely chop 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves.
1. Remove the skillet from the oven and top with the avocado and cilantro. Serve with more salsa and tortilla chips or tortillas, if desired.
