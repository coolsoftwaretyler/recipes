# Slow Cooker Tuscan Sausage Soup

## Ingredients 

* 1 lb (450g) Hot Italian sausage, casings removed (or turkey sausage)
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 celery stalk, chopped
* 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 6 russet potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
* 1/2 pound (220g) baby bella mushrooms, sliced
* 4 cups chopped kale
* 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan, for serving

## Directions

1. In a skillet, add Italian sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, and breaking up the meat until sausage is browned and cooked through. Drain the fat drippings from the pan. Add onion and celery and continue cooking for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring regularly. This step is optional but ensures we get rid of most of the fat from the sausage meat. If youâ€™d like to throw everything in the slow cooker, keep in mind the final dish might be greasy.
2. In a bowl, combine whipping cream with garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and pepper.
3. Add the cooked sausage meat, onion, and celery to the insert of the slow cooker. Add potatoes, mushroom, and seasonings and cover with chicken broth and the whipping cream mixture. Add more broth if necessary. Set on high for 4 hours or low for 6 hours.
4. Once the time is over, stir in kale and give a quick stir and reheat until kale is just wilted and the sauce is smooth. Adjust seasoning of the Tuscan sausage soup with salt and pepper, to taste.
5. Serve the Crock-Pot Tuscan Sausage Soup immediately with fresh grated Parmesan and more chili pepper flakes if you like.
