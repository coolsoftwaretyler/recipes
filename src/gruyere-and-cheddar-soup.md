# Gruyere and Cheddar Soup 

## Ingredients 

- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup grated peeled carrots
- 1/2 large yellow onion, diced
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 cups unsalted chicken broth
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1 1/4 cups freshly grated Gruy√®re
- 1/2 cup freshly grated sharp cheddar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- Freshly chopped parsley leaves and thinly sliced scallions, for serving
- Toasted focaccia, for serving

## Directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
1. Add the carrots and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened. Season with salt and pepper. Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
1. Stir in the chicken broth and white wine, then bring to a simmer on medium heat, about 4 to 5 minutes.
1. In a medium bowl, combine the cheeses with the flour, evenly coating the cheese.
1. Whisk the cheese into the soup in batches, making sure the cheese does not clump and is fully melted. Whisk for about 2 minutes, until the soup reaches a smooth consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.
1. Ladle the soup into serving bowls. Top with parsley and scallions, then serve immediately with toasted focaccia.
