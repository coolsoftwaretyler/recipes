# Best White Wine Sauce Recipe - How to Make Pasta With White Wine Sauce

## Ingredients

- Kosher salt
- 1 pound long pasta
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 to 5 garlic cloves, grated or finely chopped
- 1 1/2 cups dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon (or more) fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
- 2 ounces finely grated Parmesan (about ⅔ cup), plus more for serving
- 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. In a large pot of generously salted boiling water, cook the pasta, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (the pasta will continue to cook in the sauce). Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking liquid before draining.
1. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-low heat (you can also use a Dutch oven or another large pot if you don’t think all the pasta will fit), melt the butter and combine with the oil. Add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 to 2 minutes, until softened and fragrant. Increase the heat to medium, add the wine, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 7 minutes, until you can no longer smell the alcohol and the liquid has slightly reduced. Stir in the lemon juice and red pepper flakes, if using.
1. Transfer the pasta and ½ cup of the reserved pasta cooking liquid to the skillet. Gradually add the Parmesan, a handful at a time, then the parsley, all while tossing; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook, tossing frequently, for about 2 minutes, until all of the cheese is melted and heated through. Taste and season with more salt, black pepper, and/or lemon juice. Add more pasta cooking liquid as needed, tossing, until a smooth, glossy sauce forms., Divide the pasta among plates or bowls. Top with more grated Parmesan before serving.
