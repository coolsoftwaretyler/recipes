# Thai Red Curry Noodles

## Ingredients

- 16 ounces brown rice noodles
- 1 can full fat coconut milk
- 3-4 tbsp Thai red curry paste
- 2-3 tbsp tomato paste (start with 2, add more if needed)
- 1-2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
- 4 large cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp fresh grated ginger
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp maple syrup or honey
- Juice from 1 lime about 1-2 tbsp
- 1 tsp cornstarch tapioca or arrowroot work too
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook noodles according to package instructions. Undercook them just slightly, we'll continue cooking them a bit in the sauce.
1. In a small pot or skillet, add the minced garlic, grated ginger and olive oil. Saute until the garlic looks slightly golden brown.
1. Add the coconut milk and all remaining ingredients to the pot (aside from the cornstarch) with the garlic and whisk until smooth.
1. Bring to a boil, whisk in the corn starch, then reduce heat to low and let simmer for 2-3 minutes.
1. Once the noodles are done cooking, combine the sauce with the noodles and let simmer over low heat to let it thicken further and finish cooking the noodles. It will seem saucy at first, but the noodles will absorb a lot of the sauce as it sits. If you don't like it too saucy, start with just 1/2 of the sauce with the noodles at first and add more as desired. I usually serve it with other veggies/protein, which is why I made it create a lot of sauce, but feel free to start small if you prefer that!
1. Garnish with cilantro, scallions and red pepper flakes. Serve with your favorite protein, sauteed or steamed vegetables, or enjoy as is!
