## Ingredients

### Mashed potatoes

- 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters (about 4-6 potatoes)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 teaspoon salt

### Chicken

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 chicken breasts
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- salt, to taste
- pepper, to taste

### Dijon Cream Sauce

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (or more chicken broth)
- 3 tablespoons dijon mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- optional garnish: chopped parsley

## Directions

### Mashed Potatoes

1. Add the potatoes to a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook the potatoes until fork tender. While the potatoes boil, make the chicken and the sauce.
1. Once the potatoes finish cooking, strain the water then add the potatoes back to the pot. Add the butter, heavy cream and salt. Use an electric mixer (or potato masher) to mash the potaotes until smooth and creamy. Cover with a lid to keep warm while the chicken finishes baking.

### Chicken

1. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and garlic powder.
1. Melt the butter and olive oil in a large skillet (or fry pan with tall sides) over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and let cook for about 5 minutes until browned, then flip and cook another 5 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Now make the dijon cream sauce.

### Dijon cream sauce

1. Reduce the heat to medium. To the same skillet you cooked the chicken, add the butter and garlic; cook until the butter is melted. Whisk in the flour and let cook for one minute.
1. While whisking, gradually pour in the chicken broth then the white wine. Whisk in the dijon mustard, salt and pepper. Whisk in the heavy cream and let simmer for 1-2 minutes until slightly thickened to a gravy consistency.
1. Add the chicken back to the skillet with the sauce. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked.
1. Serve the chicken and dijon cream sauce over mashed potatoes. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
