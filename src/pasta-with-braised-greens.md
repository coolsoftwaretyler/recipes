# Pasta with Braised Greens

## Ingredients

* 1 large yellow onion
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 2 pounds hearty dark, leafy greens (about 2 large bunches), such as kale, mustard, mature spinach, Swiss chard, or collard greens
* 1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes (about 3 ounces), plus 2 tablespoons of the oil
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 3 tablespoons tomato paste, preferably double-concentrated from a tube
* 2 teaspoons hot smoked paprika
* 1 pound dried fettuccine or other long, thin pasta
* 1/2 medium lemon
* 4 ounces fresh goat or feta cheese

## Directions

1. Thinly slice 1 large yellow onion (about 2 cups). Strip the leaves from the stems of 2 pounds hearty dark greens (about 2 large bunches). Coarsely chop the greens. Coarsely chop 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes.
1. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, season with 1/4 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned at the edges, 5 to 7 minutes.
1. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, 3 tablespoons tomato paste, and 2 teaspoons hot smoked paprika. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the greens in batches, stirring between each batch until starting to wilt. Season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft but not mushy, 20 to 25 minutes. Taste every so often; if it tastes flat, add a pinch of salt. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
1. When the greens are almost ready, add 1 pound dried long, thin pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta. (If the greens are done before the pasta, keep cooking them; a few minutes wonâ€™t affect them all that much.)
1. Add the pasta, 1/2 cup of the pasta water, and 2 tablespoons sun dried-tomato oil to the greens. Toss until the pasta is glossy and the greens are evenly distributed, adding more pasta water a tablespoon at a time as needed until saucy.
1. Squeeze the juice from 1/2 medium lemon (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) over the pasta and toss to combine. Crumble 4 ounces goat or feta cheese (scant 1 cup) into the pasta. Toss just a few times to warm but not completely melt the cheese. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed.
