# ROASTED GREEN BEANS AND CARROTS - CACIO E PEPE STYLE

## Ingredients

- rainbow carrots (regular carrots will work fine, too!)
- green beans
- olive oil
- salt
- pepper
- rosemary
- pecorino or parmesan
- butter
- lemon juice

## Directions

1. First, you'll want to preheat your oven at 400F degrees.
1. Now peel the carrots and cut them down the middle. And be sure trim the ends off of the green beans.
1. Place veggies on baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and then toss with salt, pepper and rosemary.
1. Give it a good toss then place the veggies on the baking sheet and space them out.
1. Now put the sheet pan in the oven and roast at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. If they're not tender at that point, continue cooking until tender when pierced with a fork.
1. After 20 minutes, remove the sheet pan from oven and immediately toss with butter, a drizzle of lemon juice, and half the cheese. Be sure to give it a taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed.
1. Now plate and finished vegetables and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Serve immediately or at room temperature.
