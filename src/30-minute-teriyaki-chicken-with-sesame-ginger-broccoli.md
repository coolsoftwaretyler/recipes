# 30 Minute Teriyaki Chicken with Sesame Ginger Broccoli.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1/3 cup honey
- 2 tablespoons fresh grated ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated
- 1 fresno chile pepper, seeded and diced
- 1/4 cup sesame oil
- 1 pound chicken breast or thighs
- 1/2 pineapple, cut into half moons
- 2 bunches broccoli or broccolini, cut into florets
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- kosher salt and pepper
- lime wedges, cilantro, and rice, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. To make the teriyaki sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, 1 tablespoon of the ginger, garlic, and fresno pepper.
3. Heat a large, oven safe skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken and sear on both sides until lightly golden, about 2-3 minutes. Add the sauce and bring to a boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat and add the pineapple.
4. Toss the broccoli with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, remaining 1 tablespoon ginger, sesame seeds, salt and pepper. If your skillet is large enough, add the broccoli to the skillet with the chicken, if not, add to a roasting pan. Transfer both the chicken and broccoli to the oven and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the broccoli lightly charred.
5. Serve the chicken, pineapple and broccoli over a bed of rice with limes and cilantro. Enjoy!
