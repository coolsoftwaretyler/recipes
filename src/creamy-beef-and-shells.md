# Creamy Beef and Shells - Damn Delicious

## Ingredients

8 ounces medium pasta shells
1 tablespoon olive oil,
1 pound ground beef,
1/2 medium sweet onion, diced,
2 cloves garlic, minced,
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning,
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour,
2 cups beef stock,
1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce,
3/4 cup heavy cream,
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste,
6 ounces shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese, about 1 1/2 cups

## Directions

1. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; drain well.
1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat. Set aside.

1. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
1. Gradually whisk in beef stock and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced and slightly thickened, about 6-8 minutes.
1. Stir in pasta, beef and heavy cream until heated through, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in cheese until melted, about 2 minutes.
1. Serve immediately.
