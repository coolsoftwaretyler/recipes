# Risotto with Parmesan and Lemon 

## Ingredients 

1. 6 cups chicken stock
1. 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
1. 1/2 Spanish onion, finely diced
1. Kosher salt
1. 1 cup arborio rice
1. 1/2 cup dry white wine (or use chicken stock)
1. 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
1. 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives, plus more for topping
1. Grated zest of 1 lemon, plus 1 teaspoon juice
1. Freshly ground pepper

## Directions

1. Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat.
1. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and a touch of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender, about 8 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring, until toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook until evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes.
1. Add 1 cup simmering chicken stock to the rice and cook, stirring constantly, until absorbed. Repeat, adding the stock 1 cup at a time, until the rice is al dente and creamy in texture, about 20 minutes. (You might not use all of the stock.)
1. When the rice is al dente, remove from the heat and stir in the cheese, chives and lemon juice. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. 
1. Divide the risotto among shallow bowls. Drizzle with olive oil, top with the lemon zest and more chives, and season with salt and pepper.
