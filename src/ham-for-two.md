# Ham for Two

## Ingredients

* 2 ¾ cups water
* ⅓ cup packed dark brown sugar
* ¼ cup kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon curing salt
* 1 pork tenderloin, trimmed
* ½ cup maple syrup
* 1 ½ teaspoons black pepper 

## Directions

* Place water, sugar, and salts in a saucepan over high heat stirring until sugar dissolves, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
* Place pork in a nonreactive bowl or glass baking dish. Pour brine over pork. Refrigerate 24 hours.
* Preheat oven to 400°.
* Place pork on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast at 400° on the middle rack of oven for 10 minutes. Combine syrup and pepper; brush pork with maple mixture. Continue cooking pork until a thermometer inserted into the pork registers 130°, about 15 to 18 minutes, brushing with maple mixture every 5 minutes. Turn broiler to low. Continue cooking pork until a thermometer inserted into the pork registers 140° and pork is pinkish brown and caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven. Let stand 10 minutes. Slice and serve with remaining glaze.
