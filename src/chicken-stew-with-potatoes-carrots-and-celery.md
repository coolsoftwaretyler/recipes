# Chicken Stew With Potatoes, Carrots & Celery

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs
- 1 medium white onion, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- Kosher salt
- 1 sprig rosemary
- 1 sprig thyme
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 3 ribs celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 32 ounces low-sodium homemade or store-bought chicken stock
- 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- Chopped parsley, for garnish

## Directions

1. In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, heat the oil.
1. Sear the chicken for about 3 minutes on each side, until browned.
1. Transfer to a cutting board and cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Set aside.
1. In the same pot over medium heat, cook the onion and garlic, stirring, for about 3 minutes, until translucent and softened; season with salt.
1. Add the rosemary and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the carrots and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes, until translucent.
1. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes, until all of the vegetables are coated and the raw taste has cooked off. Slowly pour in the stock, stirring to break up any lumps of flour.
1. Add the chicken, potatoes, and pepper and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the chicken and potatoes are fully cooked and the liquid has slightly thickened. Taste and adjust the seasonings; discard the thyme and rosemary sprigs.
1. Divide the soup among bowls. Garnish with the parsley.
