# Honey Sriracha Chicken Recipe â€“ Slow Cooker

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs chicken breast 4-5 breasts
* 1 onion chopped
* 1/2 cup Sriracha or any chili garlic hot sauce
* 1/4 cup honey
* 2 tablespoons lime juice

## Directions

1. Place the chicken breasts and chopped onion in a slow cooker.
2. In a small bowl stir together Sriracha sauce, honey and lime juice. Add to the slow cooker and toss the chicken to coat it evenly with sauce.
3. Cook for 3-4 hours on high (or 6-8 hours on low).
4. Lift the chicken breasts from the slow cooker and shred with 2 forks. Add in as much of the cooking sauce as desired (I like it saucy and will often use all of it).
