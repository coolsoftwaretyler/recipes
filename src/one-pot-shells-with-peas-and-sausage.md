# One Pot Shells with Peas and Sausage 

## Ingredients 

* One pound ground sweet Italian sausage
* 1 small onion, peeled and chopped fine
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1/2 cup and then 3.5 cups chicken broth, separated
* 12 oz medium pasta shells
* 2 cups frozen peas
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 2 tsp grated lemon zest
* 1 tbsp lemon juice (1 lemon)

## Directions

1. Add sausage, onion, salt, pepper, and pepper flakes (if using) to Dutch oven. Use wooden spoon to break sausage into small pieces. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally and continuing to break up sausage, until sausage is lightly browned and dark brown bits have formed on bottom of pot, 10 to 12 minutes.
1. Carefully add ½ cup chicken broth and use wooden spoon to scrape up browned bits on bottom of pot. Cook until liquid has mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes.
1. Stir in pasta and remaining 3½ cups broth. Bring mixture to boil.
1. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover pot with lid. Cook until pasta is tender, 10 to 12 minutes. (Some liquid will remain in pot.) Turn off heat.
1. Use oven mitts to remove lid. Add peas, Parmesan, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Use wooden spoon to stir vigorously for 1 minute. Let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes to allow peas to warm through and sauce to thicken slightly. (Sauce will continue to thicken as pasta cools.)
1. Use ladle to divide pasta among individual bowls. Sprinkle with extra Parmesan cheese, if desired. Serve.
