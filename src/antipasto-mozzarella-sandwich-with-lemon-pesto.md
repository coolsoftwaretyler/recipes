# Antipasto Mozzarella Sandwich with Lemon Pesto

## Ingredients

- 1 loaf ciabatta bread, halved lengthwise
- 1/2 cup basil pesto (recipe follows)
- 6 slices spicy salami
- 6 slices prosciutto
- 1 cup marinated artichokes, drained and quartered
- 1 roasted red pepper, sliced
- 1/2 cup oil packed sun-dried tomatoes, oil drained and chopped
- 8 ounces fresh burrata or mozzarella
- 4 ounces provolone, sliced
- 1 cup baby arugula

### Pesto

- 2 cups fresh basil
- 1/4 tablespoons toasted pine nuts, walnuts, pistachios, or pumpkin seeds
- 1 jalape√±o, seeded, if desired
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
- zest and juice of 1 lemon
- kosher salt
- 2 cloves garlic, smashed

## Directions

1. Lay the bread cut side up on a clean work surface. Working with the top piece of the loaf, pull out some of the insides to create a space for the filling. Spread both cut sides of bread with pesto.
2. Working with the bottom piece of bread, layer on the salami, prosciutto, artichokes, red peppers, and sun-dried tomatoes. Tear the burrata and layer evenly over the veggies. Add the provolone. Sprinkle the arugula over top. Add the top half of the ciabatta and gently push down on the sandwich.
3. Wrap the sandwich tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 1 day. Before serving, cut into 4-6 sandwiches.
4. Alternately, you can warm the sandwich in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted. This is really good.

### Pesto

1. In a blender or food processor, combine all ingredients and pulse until finely chopped. Taste and add salt as needed. Keep stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
