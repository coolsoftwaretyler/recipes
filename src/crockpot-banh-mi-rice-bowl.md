# Crockpot Banh Mi Brown Rice Bowls with Asian Slaw

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs pork shoulder, (or beef chuck roast, or chicken breast!)
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup low sodium beef stock
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- salt & pepper
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 onion, peeled and quartered
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- Optional 1 tsp cayenne pepper, to taste
- 1 bag coleslaw mix, (shredded cabbage and carrots)
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tbsp mayonaise
- Sliced cucumbers
- Sliced jalapeños
- Fresh cilantro
- Cooked brown rice

## Directions

1. Add all the meat ingredients, (first ten, through cayenne pepper) to a slow cooker. Cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4. Shred meat with two forks, and let sit in the juices on warm until ready to serve.
1. Meanwhile, make the slaw: in a tupperware container or large mason jar, mix up the vinegar, white sugar, salt, and mayo. Add 2 cups of the coleslaw mix, and coat with the liquid. Cover and let sit at least an hour in the fridge. As you use the slaw, you can add more of the coleslaw mix from the bag to the remaining liquid.
1. To assemble the bowls, heat brown rice, and top with a generous portion of the shredded meat. Top with lots of coleslaw and sliced cucumbers, jalapeños, and cilantro.
