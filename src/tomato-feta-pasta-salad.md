- 2 tablespoons minced garlic (6 cloves),
- 18 large basil leaves, julienned, plus extra for serving,
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes,

- 1 pound dried angel hair pasta,
- 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving

## Directions

1. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water with a splash of oil to keep it from sticking together. Boil for 12 minutes, or according to the directions on the package. Drain well and allow to cool. Place the pasta in a bowl and add the tomatoes, olives, feta and chopped sun-dried tomatoes.
1. For the dressing, combine the sun-dried tomatoes, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, capers, salt and pepper in a food processor until almost smooth.
1. Pour the dressing over the pasta, sprinkle with the Parmesan and parsley, and toss well.
