# Spicy Italian Chicken Sausage and Kale Soup

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 3/4 pound ground spicy Italian chicken sausage
- 2 small shallots, chopped
- 4 carrots, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- kosher salt and pepper
- 6 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 1/3 cup basil pesto, homemade or store-bought
- 1 parmesan rind (the end knob of the parmesan wedge)
- juice of 1 lemon
- 1 bunch Tuscan kale, roughly chopped
- 1 pound short cut pasta
- 1 1/2 cups shredded provolone cheese

## Directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken sausage and shallots, and brown all over, about 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the carrots, sage, thyme, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook another 5 minutes. Add the broth, pesto, parmesan rind, and lemon juice. Simmer over medium heat for 15-20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat and boil the pasta until al dente according to package directions.
3. Stir the kale into the soup, cooking another five minutes. Remove the parmesan rind. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
4. Divide the noodles among bowls and pour the soup overtop. Top each bowl off with cheese and allow the cheese to melt slightly. Enjoy!
