# Best Orzo Salad Recipe With Green Beans, Tomatoes, Feta & Mint

## Ingredients

- Kosher salt
- 1 cup dried orzo
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and halved crosswise (not lengthwise, where the green bean is split open)
- 1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 small lemon, juiced
- 1/2 cup crumbled feta
- 1/4 cup fresh mint, both leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped or torn
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Salt a large pot of water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the orzo and cook until just tender with a little firmness to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain in a colander and drizzle with olive oil, mixing to coat. Set aside.
1. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a 12-inch cast-iron or heavy-weight skillet over medium-high heat. Add the green beans, season with salt, and let cook without moving until they start to sizzle and sound like they will pop, 2 Â½ to 3 minutes, so that they get contact with the pan and blister on one side. Stir, then add the tomatoes, seasoning with salt and red-pepper flakes. Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the green beans are crisp-tender and the tomatoes burst, 4 to 6 minutes more.
1. Reduce the heat to low, then add the soy sauce, stirring to combine and letting the liquid reduce, about 1 minute more. Pour in the orzo, lemon juice, and half the feta and stir so the feta melts. Take the pan off the heat and garnish with the remaining feta and mint. Season with pepper to taste and serve.
