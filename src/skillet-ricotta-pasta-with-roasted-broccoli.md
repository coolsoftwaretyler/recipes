# SKILLET RICOTTA PASTA WITH ROASTED BROCCOLI

## Ingredients

- 3 cups broccoli florets
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- kosher salt and pepper
- 8 ounces cavatappi pasta (or any noodle you like!)
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1/2 to3/4 cup reserved pasta water
- crushed red pepper flakes, for topping
- parmesan cheese, optional, for sprinkling

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the broccoli florets on a baking sheet and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil (or use a spray olive oil if you wish!). Season all over with salt and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes, or until golden and slightly charred.
1. While the broccoli is roasting, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook your pasta according to the directions. Remember to reserve your pasta water!
1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the ricotta cheese. It will take a few minutes for it to become creamy. Add a big pinch of salt and pepper. Stir in the lemon juice and ½ cup of reserved pasta water until the sauce is smooth and silky. You can add a bit more pasta water if you find it needs to be thinner or smoother! This will all depend on the brand of your ricotta. Taste the ricotta mixture and add more salt and pepper if needed. Don't skip tasting it!
1. Add in the pasta and toss well to coat in the ricotta mixture. Toss in the roasted broccoli.
1. Top with crushed red pepper flakes and serve! Sprinkle with parmesan if you’d like!
